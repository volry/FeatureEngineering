# Feature Engineering 
> Hello everyone, here I decided to collect some usefull ~~for me~~ steps,  functions, 
> methods for dataset feature engineering

## Feature Engineering steps:
1. Load dataset
2. reduce data size
3. find target variable (it's important)
+ find out if there are enough values to say we have balanced data
4. split dataset into train and test
5.
